# üßë‚Äçüíª Capstone Labs Guide ‚Äî TechOps Inc.

This guide helps you navigate all Capstone labs with clarity.  
It shows **which role is responsible**, and **which labs can run in parallel** to optimize the 3-day schedule.

## ‚ö° Parallelization Strategy

- **Day 1 (Setup):**  
  Labs 02 + 03 can run in parallel.  
  Labs 04 ‚Üí 05 must follow sequentially.  

- **Day 2 (Build & Infra):**  
  Labs 06 (Jenkins EC2) and 09 (App build) can proceed in parallel.  
  Lab 07 (Jenkins Ansible) must wait for 06.  
  Lab 08 (Credentials) can overlap with app-related work (09 ‚Üí 10).  

- **Day 3 (Integration & Monitoring):**  
  DevOps flows (11 ‚Üí 12 ‚Üí 13) are sequential.  
  Monitoring (14 ‚Üí 15) can run parallel to deployments.  
  Backup (16) can run alongside monitoring tasks.  
  Incident Drill (17) only after deployments & monitoring.

## ‚úÖ Pro Tip
Use **Scrum-style coordination**:  
- Daily syncs (15 mins max).  
- Assign dependencies clearly.  
- Document everything in your repo as you go.
