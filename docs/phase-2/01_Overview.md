# Phase 2: Virtualization, Cloud, and Modern Data Center Management

## Overview
In this phase, we move beyond physical infrastructure to explore **virtualization, cloud technologies, and modern approaches to data center operations**. Students will learn how to abstract, pool, and manage resources efficiently while ensuring scalability, availability, and automation.  

This phase sets the foundation for understanding how todayâ€™s IT infrastructure is built, operated, and optimized in enterprises.

## Topics Covered

### 1. Virtualization Foundations
- Introduction to virtualization concepts  
- Types of virtualization: Type 1 (bare-metal) and Type 2 (hosted)  
- Advanced techniques: hardware virtualization, para-virtualization, cloning, snapshots, and templates  
- Operating system-level virtualization  

### 2. High Availability & Storage
- Cluster architecture and requirements  
- Configuring and managing a SAN (using FreeNAS)  
- Leveraging SANs for high availability  
- ZFS volume management  
- IP-based storage communication  
- Object storage services  

### 3. Cloud Computing Essentials
- Introduction to cloud computing  
- Cloud architecture and deployment models: Public, Private, Hybrid  
- Service models: IaaS, PaaS, SaaS  
- Key services: compute, storage, databases, developer tools, security, and more  
- Cloud SPI model and security (SLA and IAM)  
- Cloud development best practices  
- Introduction to OpenStack  
- Hyper-Converged Infrastructure (HCI) and its comparison with cloud  
- Software-Defined Networking (SDN)  
- Cloud API integration  

### 4. Data Center & Disaster Recovery (DC/DR)
- Migration of workloads and servers to the cloud  
- DC/DR migration strategies  
- Storage synchronization across DC/DR sites  
- Bootstrapping configuration management tools (Chef/Puppet)  

### 5. Cloud Operations & Monitoring
- Centralized logging and observability  
- Monitoring with Nagios and Prometheus (next-gen NMS)  
- Identifying and resolving performance bottlenecks  
- Auto-scaling, auto-rebuilding, and auto-healing of cloud instances  
- Techniques for updating servers without downtime  

### 6. Case Study
- Real-world **Cloud-Enabled Data Center** design and operations case study
