# Different Names of Services Provided by Public Cloud Providers

!!! tip "Learning Goal"
    Understand that **all major cloud providers offer similar services**, but each uses different names.  
    This chapter helps students quickly map services between **AWS, Azure, and GCP**, so they donâ€™t get confused when switching providers.

---

## ðŸ”‘ Why this matters
- When you move between providers (or read documentation), youâ€™ll encounter **different terms** for the **same concept**.  
- Knowing this mapping makes it easier to learn once and apply everywhere.  
- Example: AWS **S3** = Azure **Blob Storage** = GCP **Cloud Storage** â†’ all are **object storage services**.

## ðŸ§­ Key Takeaway
- The **services are almost the same** â€” what changes is the **branding**.  
- If you know how to use one, learning the equivalent in another provider is much easier.  
- Focus on **concepts like compute, storage, networking, databases, identity, serverless**.
