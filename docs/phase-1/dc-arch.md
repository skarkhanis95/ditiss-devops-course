## Data Center Architecture, Requirements & Prerequisites

#### What is it?
The blueprint and essential conditions required to establish a functional and reliable data center.

#### Theoretical Definition
Data center architecture defines the **physical and logical layout** of servers, storage, networking, power, cooling, and security systems that support business applications and services.

#### Why is it Important?
- Provides **structure** for building and scaling.  
- Ensures **availability, scalability, and security**.  
- A poor design can cause **bottlenecks, downtime, and inefficiency**.

#### How is it Planned?
- Define IT needs (compute, storage, network).  
- Allocate supporting infra (power, cooling, space).  
- Plan redundancy (no single point of failure).  
- Consider modular growth.  

#### How Can it Impact Down the Line?
- Well-architected = efficient, scalable, secure. 
- Poorly architected = outages, costly retrofits.

#### Real World Example
AWS data centers are built in **Availability Zones**. Each zone is independent but interconnected for redundancy. This architecture lets AWS guarantee high availability.
