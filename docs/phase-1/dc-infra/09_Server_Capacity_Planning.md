# Server Capacity Planning


## 1. What is it?  
**Server Capacity Planning** is the process of making sure your servers have the right amount of resources (CPU, memory, storage, and network bandwidth) to handle current workloads and future growth.  
It prevents both **under-provisioning** (not enough resources, causing downtime) and **over-provisioning** (too many resources, wasting money).  

---

## 2. Theoretical Definition  
Capacity planning is a **forecasting and resource management practice** used to determine the IT infrastructure requirements needed to meet expected demand within defined service levels.  

Key parameters include:  
- **CPU & Processing Power** â†’ Handles applications and users.  
- **RAM (Memory)** â†’ Supports multitasking, virtualization, and performance.  
- **Storage** â†’ Ensures enough space for data, backups, and future expansion.  
- **Network Bandwidth** â†’ Handles incoming/outgoing data traffic.

## 3. Why is it important?  
- **Avoids Downtime** â†’ Ensures systems donâ€™t crash under peak load.  
- **Optimizes Cost** â†’ Prevents buying more hardware than necessary.  
- **Improves Performance** â†’ Applications run smoothly with right-sized resources.  
- **Supports Scalability** â†’ Plans for business growth and seasonal traffic spikes.  
- **Meets SLAs** â†’ Keeps response times and uptime commitments.

## 4. How is it planned?  

Steps in server capacity planning:  

1. **Measure Current Usage**  

    - Collect utilization metrics (CPU %, memory usage, storage I/O).  
    - Use monitoring tools like Nagios, Prometheus, or vCenter.  

2. **Forecast Future Needs**  
   
    - Predict growth (new apps, more users, higher traffic).  
    - Factor in peak usage patterns (e.g., end-of-month billing, holiday shopping).  

3. **Set Performance Targets**  

    - Define acceptable latency, response times, and uptime goals.  

4. **Plan for Redundancy**  

    - Use N+1 server design (one extra server for every N in production).  

5. **Implement and Review**  

    - Deploy resources.  
    - Continuously review and adjust capacity plans.

## 5. Impact if not done correctly  
- **Under-Provisioning** â†’ Servers crash during peak loads, leading to downtime.  
- **Over-Provisioning** â†’ Wasted money on unused servers and electricity.  
- **Inaccurate Forecasting** â†’ SLA violations and poor customer experience.  
- **No Redundancy** â†’ A single server failure may bring down critical services.  

---

## 6. Real World Example  
- **Netflix** uses predictive analytics to scale servers ahead of peak streaming hours (like evenings and weekends).  
- **E-commerce companies** like Amazon add extra capacity during events like Black Friday sales.  
- A **bank** may forecast server needs for end-of-quarter financial reporting to handle huge transaction spikes.

ðŸ‘‰ Easy Analogy:  
Server capacity planning is like **planning seats on an airplane**:  
- Too few seats â†’ passengers left behind (downtime).  
- Too many empty seats â†’ wasted fuel and money (overprovisioning).  
The goal is to have the **right number of seats for the expected passengers**.
