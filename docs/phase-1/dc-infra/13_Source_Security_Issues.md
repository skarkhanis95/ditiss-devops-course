# Source Security Issues

## 1. What is it?  
**Source Security Issues** are risks that originate from within the organization or through external sources such as vendors, contractors, or compromised software components.  
They are often harder to detect because they come from **trusted sources**.  

---

## 2. Theoretical Definition  
Source security issues are vulnerabilities or threats that arise from:  
- **Insider Threats** â†’ Employees or contractors misusing access intentionally or accidentally.  
- **Supply Chain Risks** â†’ Malicious code, compromised hardware, or weak vendor security.  
- **Unverified Sources** â†’ Downloading software, scripts, or updates from untrusted origins.  

---

## 3. Why is it important?  
- **High Impact** â†’ Attackers can bypass defenses since the source is trusted.  
- **Difficult Detection** â†’ Malicious activity often looks legitimate.  
- **Regulatory Impact** â†’ Violations if sensitive data is leaked.  
- **Business Risk** â†’ Can lead to financial loss and reputational damage.

## 4. How is it planned?  

Strategies to mitigate source security issues:  
- **Vendor Risk Management**

    - Conduct security audits of third-party vendors.  
    - Use contracts with security clauses (SLAs, compliance requirements).  

- **Access Control**  

    - Implement the principle of least privilege.  
    - Monitor privileged accounts closely.  

- **Software Integrity**  

    - Only use signed and verified software updates.  
    - Conduct code reviews and vulnerability scans.  

- **Insider Threat Detection** 
 
    - Monitor logs for unusual user behavior.  
    - Use tools like UEBA (User and Entity Behavior Analytics).

## 5. Impact if not done correctly  
- **Supply Chain Compromise** â†’ Attackers inject malware into trusted software updates.  
- **Insider Abuse** â†’ Employees leaking or stealing data.  
- **Malware Propagation** â†’ Through downloads from unverified sources.  
- **Loss of Customer Trust** â†’ Customers lose confidence in your ability to safeguard data.  

---

## 6. Real World Example  
- **SolarWinds Attack (2020)** â†’ Hackers compromised a trusted software update, impacting thousands of organizations worldwide.  
- **Edward Snowden (2013)** â†’ Insider with high-level access leaked classified NSA documents.  
- **Target Breach (2013)** â†’ Attackers gained entry through a third-party HVAC vendorâ€™s compromised credentials.

ðŸ‘‰ Easy Analogy:  
Source security issues are like **someone you trust bringing a Trojan horse inside your home**.  
- Outsiders may be locked out (firewalls), but insiders or trusted partners can unintentionally (or maliciously) open the door from within.
