## Required Power

#### What is it?
The electricity needed to operate all IT and supporting equipment.

#### Theoretical Definition
The total electrical load required for IT hardware + support systems, including redundancy (UPS, generators).

#### Why is it Important?
- **Downtime risk**: Power loss = service outage.  
- Redundant power ensures business continuity.  
- Major cost factor in OPEX.  

#### How is it Planned?
- Estimate rack power (3â€“5 kW typical, 10+ kW high density).  
- Deploy UPS, generators (N+1, 2N redundancy).  
- Use PDUs for safe distribution.  

#### Impact Down the Line
Under-provisioning = outages; over-provisioning = wasted CAPEX.  
High consumption = poor efficiency (high PUE).

#### Real World Example
In 2017, British Airways lost ~$100M after a power surge crippled its data center, halting flights worldwide.
