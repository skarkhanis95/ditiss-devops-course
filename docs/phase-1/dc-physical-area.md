## Required Physical Area

#### What is it?
The space needed to host IT equipment, infrastructure, and personnel.

#### Theoretical Definition
The required floor space (measured in square feet or meters) necessary for racks, cooling units, cabling, and clearance zones.

#### Why is it Important?
- Determines **capacity** of the data center.  
- Inadequate space → growth limitations.  
- Impacts **cooling and airflow**.  

#### How is it Planned?
- Calculate rack count + clearance.  
- Reserve 20–30% for growth.  
- Plan zones (server halls, NOC, staging).  

#### Impact Down the Line
Too small = frequent migrations. Too large = high cost for unused space.

#### Real World Example
A mid-size enterprise DC (50 racks) may require ~5,000 sq. ft. of raised floor.
