## Required Network Bandwidth

#### What is it?
The amount of network capacity needed for data transfer.

#### Theoretical Definition
Network bandwidth = maximum rate of data transfer between servers and the internet/backbone.

#### Why is it Important?
- High-speed links ensure low latency.  
- Redundancy prevents outages.  
- Drives application performance.  

#### How is it Planned?
- Estimate workload traffic.  
- Enterprise: 10–40 Gbps. Hyperscale: 100–400 Gbps.  
- Use multiple ISPs for redundancy.  

#### Impact Down the Line
Under-provisioned = latency, downtime. Over-provisioned = unnecessary cost.

#### Real World Example
Banks often contract with **two ISPs** for redundant connections to ensure 24/7 services.
