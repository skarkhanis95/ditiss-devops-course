## Selecting a Geographic Location

#### What is it?
The physical site where the data center is built.

#### Theoretical Definition
Strategic placement of DCs based on latency, utilities, and disaster risk.

#### Why is it Important?
- Impacts **latency, cost, and availability**.  
- Wrong location = constant outages or high costs.  

#### How is it Planned?
- Proximity to users.  
- Safe zone (no floods/earthquakes).  
- Nearby utilities + political stability.  

#### Impact Down the Line
Wrong choice = business disruption, higher OPEX.

#### Real World Example
Facebook chose Sweden for cold climate â†’ reduced cooling costs drastically.

## Safe from Natural Hazards & Manmade Disasters

#### What is it?
Ensuring DC is resilient against natural and human risks.

#### Theoretical Definition
Designing with disaster-avoidance and mitigation in mind (earthquake, flood, fire, sabotage).

#### Why is it Important?
- Protects **business continuity**.  
- Avoids catastrophic downtime.  

#### How is it Planned?
- Choose safe locations.  
- Fire suppression (FM200 gas).  
- Earthquake-resistant design.  

#### Impact Down the Line
Ignoring this = catastrophic outages, massive losses.

#### Real World Example
Hurricane Sandy (2012) flooded several NYC DCs, halting trading and services.

## Availability of Local Technical Talent

#### What is it?
Skilled workforce near the DC site.

#### Theoretical Definition
Access to trained IT, HVAC, and electrical staff for smooth operation.

#### Why is it Important?
- Skilled staff reduce downtime.  
- Easier hiring = lower costs.  

#### How is it Planned?
- Build near metro hubs/university towns.  
- Offer competitive salaries.  

#### Impact Down the Line
No skilled staff = long downtime, slow fixes.

#### Real World Example
Northern Virginia is a DC hub partly due to a rich pool of skilled engineers.

## Abundant & Inexpensive Utilities

#### What is it?
Access to reliable and cost-effective electricity and water.

#### Theoretical Definition
Utility availability ensures continuous power and cooling resources.

#### Why is it Important?
- Energy = biggest OPEX factor.  
- Water = needed for cooling.  

#### How is it Planned?
- Partner with utility providers.  
- Use renewable energy for cost savings.  

#### Impact Down the Line
Utility shortages = downtime. Expensive power = unsustainable OPEX.

#### Real World Example
Google DCs run partially on renewable energy contracts to reduce dependency and costs.

## Selecting an Existing Building

#### What is it?
Reusing a current structure for data center use.

#### Theoretical Definition
Retrofit of commercial/industrial buildings into DC facilities.

#### Why is it Important?
- Can save CAPEX.  
- But may limit scalability.  

#### How is it Planned?
- Assess structural capacity, cooling, and power.  
- Renovate accordingly.  

#### Impact Down the Line
Mismatched retrofits = costly operational issues.

#### Real World Example
Many banks retrofit old office spaces into secure private DCs.
