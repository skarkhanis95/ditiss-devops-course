## Required Cooling & HVAC

#### What is it?
The system that removes heat generated by IT equipment.

#### Theoretical Definition
HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, Air Conditioning) systems maintain optimal temperature and humidity in data centers.

#### Why is it Important?
- Prevents **overheating and hardware damage**.  
- Stabilizes environment for performance.  
- Energy efficiency driver (cooling can consume ~40% of DC power).  

#### How is it Planned?
- Hot aisle/cold aisle containment.  
- Raised floor airflow or overhead ducts.  
- Liquid cooling for dense racks.  

#### Impact Down the Line
Poor cooling = outages, hardware failures. Overcooling = wasted energy costs.

#### Real World Example
Google pioneered liquid cooling for AI workloads (>10 kW per rack) to manage extreme heat.
