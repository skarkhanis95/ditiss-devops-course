## Required Weight

#### What is it?
The structural load capacity required to support racks and equipment.

#### Theoretical Definition
The maximum weight per rack/floor tile that the data center floor must withstand without sagging.

#### Why is it Important?
- Prevents floor collapse or structural failure.  
- Critical in retrofitting existing buildings.  

#### How is it Planned?
- Calculate average rack weight (1,000â€“2,000 lbs).  
- Verify load-bearing capacity of raised floors.  

#### Impact Down the Line
Insufficient planning = structural damage, safety hazards.

#### Real World Example
Modern DC designs use reinforced flooring capable of supporting high-density racks.
