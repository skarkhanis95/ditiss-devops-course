## Budget Constraints

#### What is it?
The financial limits for building and operating a data center.

#### Theoretical Definition
Capital expenditure (CAPEX) for construction and Operational expenditure (OPEX) for ongoing running costs.

#### Why is it Important?
- Budget dictates design choices.  
- Poor budgeting leads to cut corners (security/power risks).  

#### How is it Planned?
- Estimate upfront build costs + yearly OPEX.  
- Balance on-prem, colocation, or cloud models.  

#### Impact Down the Line
Overbudget = project fails. Underbudget = unreliable DC.

#### Real World Example
A hyperscale DC may cost >$500M, while a mid-size enterprise DC ~ $5â€“10M.
