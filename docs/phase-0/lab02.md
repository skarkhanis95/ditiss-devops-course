# Lab 02 — Agile Project Management with Jira

!!! info "Format"
    **Duration:** 2 hours (guided lab)  
    **Objective:** Onboard into Jira, explore Scrum vs Kanban boards, and create first tickets for upcoming labs.  
    **Tools:** Jira Cloud (web app), Instructor’s demo board.  
    **Pre-requisites:** Slack workspace (Lab 01).

---

## Objectives
By the end of this lab, you will:
- Join your team’s **Jira project**.  
- Understand Jira’s structure: Epics, Stories, Sub-tasks.  
- Differentiate between **Scrum boards** and **Kanban boards**.  
- Explore the **backlog** and **active sprint**.  
- Create and move your own tickets.  

---

## Step 1 — Instructor Demo: The Master Board
Your instructor will show a Jira board for the **entire course**:

- **Epic:** *DITISS Course August 2025*  
- **Features (per phase):**  
  
    - Phase 1: Infrastructure Foundations (S6–S9)  
    - Phase 2: Virtualization & Cloud (S10–S13)  
    - Phase 3: DevOps Foundations (S14–S17)  
    - Phase 4: CI/CD & Monitoring (S18–S20)  
    - Phase 5: Security & HA (S21–S23)  
  
- **Stories:** Individual lab items (e.g., *Install Ubuntu VM*, *Configure SAN*, *Build Docker image*).  

This shows how the **course itself is a project**, with sprints, backlog, and tracking.

## Step 2 — Join Your Team’s Jira Project

1. Check your **email invite** from Jira.  
2. Click the link → accept invitation.  
3. If prompted, create a Jira account (free, using your email ID).  
4. Once inside, you’ll see your team’s project (e.g., *Company Alpha Project*).  

---

## Step 3 — Explore the Scrum Board

1. On the left menu, click **“Active Sprints”**.  
2. You’ll see:
   
    - Sprint name (e.g., *Sprint 1: Sessions 6–9*).  
    - Sprint board with columns: *To Do → In Progress → Done*.  
    - Cards (stories) representing tasks.  
  
3. Click a card to open its details. Look for:  
   
    - Summary (title)  
    - Description (instructions)  
    - Assignee (who’s doing it)  
    - Status (To Do, In Progress, Done)  

---

## Step 4 — Explore the Kanban Board

1. On the left menu, click **“Kanban Board”** (sometimes named “Board” or “Workflow”).  
2. You’ll see a continuous flow of tasks across columns: *To Do → In Progress → Review → Done*.  
3. Unlike Scrum, Kanban has **no fixed sprint**; work flows continuously.  

---

## Step 5 — Explore the Backlog

1. Click **Backlog** in the left menu.  
2. You’ll see:
   
    - *Epics* (big themes).  
    - *Stories* (lab tasks).  
    - *Sprint 1* already created by instructor.  
  
3. Scroll through items in Sprint 1 backlog. These are the labs you’ll do next.  

---

## Step 6 — Create Your Own Ticket

1. In the backlog, click **“Create Issue”**.  
2. Fill in:
   
    - **Summary:** “Install Ubuntu VM (my personal lab)”  
    - **Description:** Write steps briefly (download ISO, create VM, snapshot).  
    - **Issue Type:** Story  
    - **Epic Link:** Phase 1 → Infrastructure Foundations  
    - **Sprint:** Sprint 1  
    - **Assignee:** Yourself  
  
3. Click **Create**. Your ticket now appears in Sprint 1.  

---

## Step 7 — Work with Your Ticket

1. Drag your ticket from **To Do → In Progress** (start work).  
2. Once finished, drag it to **Done**.  
3. Add a comment on the ticket:  
   ```
   Lab 02 test completed ✅
   ```
4. Add a reaction emoji on someone else’s ticket for practice.  

---

## Step 8 — Team Activity
- Each student creates **1–2 tickets** under Sprint 1.  
- Team Lead (Scrum Master) ensures all tickets are distributed across members.  
- Discuss as a team:  
  
    - Which tasks feel like **Scrum work** (time-boxed, labs)?  
    - Which feel like **Kanban work** (ongoing, support)?  

---

## Deliverables
- Successfully joined Jira project.  
- Viewed Scrum board, Kanban board, and backlog.  
- Created at least **one ticket** under Sprint 1.  
- Moved your ticket across columns (*To Do → In Progress → Done*).  
- Added a comment and interacted with another ticket.  

---

## Reflection (write in lab notebook)
Answer briefly:
1. What’s the main difference between Scrum and Kanban boards?  
2. Which Jira feature do you think will be most useful in managing your labs?  
3. Was ticket creation and assignment straightforward?  

---

## ✅ Key Takeaways
- Jira = **project management hub** for your team.  
- Scrum board = sprint planning & delivery.  
- Kanban board = continuous flow.  
- Tickets = represent lab tasks you’ll work on.  
- Jira + Slack + GitHub = the core DevOps collaboration stack you’ll use all semester.
