## Agile

Agile is a way of working that delivers value **in small, useful slices**, learning from feedback quickly, and adapting plans as we go. Instead of locking a big plan for months, Agile asks:  
**“What’s the next most valuable thing we can deliver in the next short cycle?”**

**Core ideas**
- Deliver in **small batches** (1–2 week cycles).
- Focus on **customer/stakeholder value**.
- Gather **fast feedback** and adapt.
- Encourage **collaboration** across teams.
- **Respond to change** instead of resisting it.

!!! example "Everyday Example"
    You’re building a college fest website.  
    - Week 1: deliver the **schedule page**.  
    - Week 2: add **speaker bios**.  
    - Week 3: add **ticketing**.  
    After week 1, you learn most users are on **mobile**, so you adjust next week’s plan to improve mobile experience.  
    → That’s Agile: deliver → learn → adjust.
