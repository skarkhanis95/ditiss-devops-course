!!! info "Format"
    **Duration:** 1 hours (guided lab)  
    **Objective:** Get every student onboarded to Slack, organized into teams, and familiar with ChatOps basics.  
    **Tools:** Slack (web or desktop app), MS Forms (for team registration).  
    **Pre-requisites:** None. This is your first hands-on lab.

---

## Objectives
By the end of this lab, you will:
- Join the **course Slack workspace**.  
- Understand Slack’s structure: workspaces, channels, and direct messages.  
- Work inside your **team’s private channel**.  
- Explore public channels (`#announcements`, `#q-and-a`, etc.).  
- Practice **1-on-1 and group chats**.  
- Learn how Slack will integrate with **project tools (Taiga, GitHub, Jenkins)** in future labs.  

---

## Step 1 — Register your team
1. Your instructor will share a **Microsoft Forms link**.  
2. Fill in:
    
    - Full name  
    - Email ID (use the same one you’ll use for Slack)  
    - Assigned team name (Company A, B, C… as given)  

3. Submit the form and wait for confirmation.

3. This ensures you are properly placed into your **company team of 8–10 members**.

## Step 2 — Install or open Slack
1. Go to: [https://slack.com/downloads](https://slack.com/downloads)  
2. Choose:
   
    - **Desktop app** (Windows/Mac/Linux) → *recommended*  
    - **Mobile app** (optional, good for notifications)  
    - **Web version** (via browser, but limited offline features)  
3. Install and open Slack.  
4. Sign in using the **invite link** your instructor provides.  

---

## Step 3 — Join the workspace
1. Click the invite link → accept.  
2. Enter your **full name** (first + last).  
3. Upload a **profile picture** (optional but recommended for team recognition).  
4. You are now inside the **course Slack workspace**.  

---

## Step 4 — Explore Slack interface
Take a few minutes to look around:
- **Left sidebar:** Channels, DMs, Apps.  
- **Top search bar:** Search across messages, files, people.  
- **Message box:** Write messages, attach files, add emojis.  
- **Threads:** Reply in context to keep conversations organized.  

---

## Step 5 — Join your team channel
1. Your instructor will create a **private team channel** for each company (e.g., `#team-alpha`, `#team-beta`).  
2. Navigate to the left sidebar → “Channels” → join your team’s channel.  
3. Post a short **intro message**:
   ```
   Hi team, I’m <Your Name>. Excited to start!
   ```
4. Pin a message with your team name, members list, and roles (assigned later).

---

## Step 6 — Explore public channels
- `#announcements`: For course-wide updates (read-only).  
- `#q-and-a`: Ask course-related questions.  
- `#helpdesk`: Report issues during labs.  
- `#general`: Open discussion, not specific to any team.  

Post a short message in `#q-and-a` like:
```
Test message: Hello everyone, I can post here!
```

---

## Step 7 — Practice 1-on-1 & group chat
1. Click **Direct Messages (DMs)** in the left sidebar.  
2. Start a DM with one teammate:  
   - “Hi <name>, testing 1-on-1 chat!”  
3. Start a **group DM** with 2–3 teammates.  

---

## Step 8 — Explore Slack features
- **Reactions:** Add emoji to messages (👍, ✅, 🚀).  
- **Threads:** Reply inside a message thread to keep discussions neat.  
- **Files:** Upload a screenshot or a PDF into your team channel.  
- **Search:** Try searching for your own message with a keyword.  
- **Pinning:** Pin an important message in your team channel (like “Team Charter”).  

---

## Step 9 — Post your first Lab update
In your **team channel**, post a short lab update using this format:

```
Lab 01 completed ✅
- Joined workspace
- Introduced myself
- Tested 1:1 chat
- Posted in #q-and-a
```

This format will be used in **every lab going forward** (mini status update = part of DevOps culture).

## Reflection (write in lab notebook)
Answer briefly:
1. Was Slack easy to set up?
