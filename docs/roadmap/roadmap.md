# Course Roadmap — IT Infrastructure & DevOps (PG-DITISS Aug 2025)

Welcome to the **Course Roadmap**. This page gives you a **high-level overview** of all sessions, showing what you’ll learn in each, before diving into the detailed session pages.

## Phase 0 – Foundations: Agile & DevOps Mindset

!!! info "Target Dates"

    - **Start Date:** 04-Oct-2025
    - **End Date:** 04-Oct-2025

Phase 0 lays the foundation for the course by shifting the students’ mindset from traditional IT delivery to Agile and DevOps-oriented thinking.

- Students begin with Agile principles and frameworks (Scrum, Kanban, XP) to internalize iterative, customer-focused development.
- They then connect these ideas with Lean practices to understand waste reduction, value streams, and continuous improvement.
- The **lab track** is designed to immediately immerse students in real-world Agile environments:
    - Lab 00 gets them onboarded with Slack, Taiga, and GitHub—the same tools used in enterprise DevOps teams.
    - Lab 01 simulates a Scrum sprint, ensuring they grasp backlog creation, ceremonies, and roles.
    - Lab 02 introduces Kanban workflows to highlight flow and WIP limits.

By the end of Phase 0, students are **“workplace ready”** with collaboration platforms configured and hands-on experience in Agile project execution. This prepares them to enter the infrastructure and DevOps-heavy sessions in later phases with the right team-based, iterative mindset.

## Phase 1 – Data Center Management

!!! info "Target Dates"

    - **Start Date:** 05-Oct-2025
    - **End Date:** 05-Oct-2025


Phase 1 dives into Data Center Management, equipping students with the knowledge to design, evaluate, and operate enterprise-class data centers.

- **Part A** introduces data center management fundamentals: architecture, physical requirements, power and cooling systems, networking, site selection, and budget considerations. Students learn what constitutes a “good design” and how classification standards like Uptime Institute Tiers guide resilience and availability.

- **Part B** focuses on the infrastructure inside the data center, covering modular cabling, distribution points, WAN connectivity, NOC operations, and security measures (physical, logical, and internet-facing). Students also explore consolidation strategies, server design, capacity planning, and disaster recovery.

The phase ends with security guidelines, source security issues, and system administration best practices, culminating in automation approaches to streamline operations.

By completing Phase 1, students will be able to design and evaluate a data center for TechOps Inc., considering cost, performance, and resilience trade-offs—a crucial foundation before moving into virtualization, cloud, and DevOps practices in later phases.

## Phase 2 · Virtualization & Cloud

!!! info "Target Dates"

    - **Start Date:** 06-Oct-2025
    - **End Date:** 12-Oct-2025


Phase 2 transitions students from traditional infrastructure (Phase 1) to virtualization and cloud environments.

**Virtualization:** Students begin with concepts, hypervisors, OS virtualization, and clustering. Labs 03–04 provide hands-on VM deployment and networking with VirtualBox.

**SAN:** They then explore enterprise storage with SANs, including high availability, redundancy, and performance testing (Labs 05–09).

**Cloud Computing:** The final and largest part of Phase 2 covers public and private clouds, starting with OpenStack and SDN, then moving to AWS/Azure/GCP. Students complete labs in cloud migration, monitoring, and disaster recovery (Labs 10–15).

By the end of Phase 2, students can:

- Build and manage virtualized infrastructure.
- Configure SAN storage systems with high availability.
- Deploy workloads to public cloud platforms.
- Automate, monitor, and migrate resources across hybrid environments.

This phase builds the practical foundation for DevOps workflows, setting the stage for CI/CD, containers, and automation in Phase 3.

## Phase 3 · DevOps

!!! info "Target Dates"

    - **Start Date:** 13-Oct-2025
    - **End Date:** 19-Oct-2025

Phase 3 is the core DevOps implementation phase, where students move from infrastructure and cloud (Phase 2) into automation, orchestration, and continuous delivery.

- **Foundations:** Students learn DevOps culture, lifecycle, and foundational tools like Git, Jenkins, Docker, and Kubernetes. Labs 16–21 ensure hands-on tool familiarity.

- **IaC with Terraform:** Students provision real cloud infrastructure (EC2, VPCs) using Terraform, practicing declarative automation (Labs 22–23).

- **Containers & Microservices:** Students build and orchestrate containerized applications with Kubernetes, simulating real enterprise microservices deployments (Labs 24–25).

- **Configuration Management:** Students automate server provisioning and configuration using Ansible (Labs 26–27).

By the end of Phase 3, students can:

- Set up complete DevOps toolchains.
- Automate cloud infrastructure provisioning.
- Deploy and scale microservices with Kubernetes.
- Manage configurations using Ansible.

This phase makes them job-ready as DevOps engineers, integrating tools, automation, and real-world workflows.
